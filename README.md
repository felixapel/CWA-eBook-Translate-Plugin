# CWA Translate Plugin

Bilingual LLM-powered translation overlay for [Calibre-Web-Automated](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated). Translate ebooks paragraph-by-paragraph while reading, using local LLMs (vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama) or any major Cloud API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Together, MiniMax, DeepSeek, OpenRouter).

<!-- TODO before public launch: add a 15-20s GIF of bilingual reading here.
     For a reader plugin the GIF is the pitch. -->

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Bilingual reading** — original + translation side by side
- 🔄 **Three modes** — Bilingual / Translation-only / Original
- ⚡ **Visible-First Translation** — prioritizes paragraphs visible on screen for instant rendering
- 🚀 **Background Prefetching** — translates the rest of the chapter sequentially in the background
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support** — built-in language selector and UI localized to browser language
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Translation** — feeds surrounding paragraphs to the LLM to improve literary quality and character voice
- 📚 **Deep DOM Parsing** — accurately captures headings, custom title classes, and clickable TOC links
- 💾 **Persistent Double Cache** — server-side SQLite (SHA-256) + client-side `localStorage` caching ensures you never lose a translation or re-pay API costs
- 🔒 **Rate limited & Stable** — request-size caps and per-IP rate limiting protect your API keys and GPU from runaway requests, with `AbortController` cancellation for perfectly responsive UI buttons
- 🔌 **Zero-touch install** — proxy-injection mode overlays a **stock** CWA container: no template mounts, nothing to re-apply when CWA updates

## 🚀 Installation

### Recommended: proxy-injection mode (one extra container, stock CWA)

The translator container sits in front of CWA and injects the overlay into
reader pages on the fly. Your CWA container stays completely untouched.

```text
Browser ──► book-translator (:8084) ──► Calibre-Web-Automated (:8083, stock)
                 │ injects overlay on /read/ pages
                 └─ /bt-api → translation API (same origin, no CORS)
```

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> CWA-translate-plugin
cd CWA-translate-plugin
# Edit docker-compose.yml: set BT_LOCAL_URL (or a cloud provider + API key)
docker compose up -d
```

Then read your library at **`http://<host>:8084`** — the translator control
bar appears in the ebook reader. That's the whole install.

Already have CWA running? Add just the translator service to your existing
compose file and point `CWA_UPSTREAM` at your CWA container/host, e.g.
`CWA_UPSTREAM=http://calibre-web-automated:8083`. The host port (`8084` in the
example) is arbitrary — pick any free port on your machine.

> Removing the plugin = stop reading through the proxy port. Nothing in your
> CWA install was modified.

### Behind a reverse proxy (SWAG / Traefik / NPM / Cloudflare)

If you already expose CWA on a domain, point your reverse proxy's **main
location at the translator's proxy port instead of CWA's port** — the overlay
then works on your domain with the API same-origin (no CORS, no extra routes).
Verified SWAG example (only the main location changes; keep OPDS/Kobo sync
locations pointing directly at CWA):

```nginx
    location / {
        include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
        include /config/nginx/resolver.conf;
        set $upstream_app 192.168.0.122;   # docker host
        set $upstream_port 8084;           # translator proxy port (NOT CWA's)
        set $upstream_proto http;
        proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;
    }
```

The injection proxy forwards your reverse proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto`, so
HTTPS sessions and secure cookies keep working.

### Option 2: Unraid (community-applications style)

`install_unraid.sh` copies the overlay files into your CWA appdata folder and
installs an Unraid Docker template for the API (bind-mount method). Review the
script, then run it **locally** (don't pipe an unreviewed remote script into
`bash`):

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> CWA-translate-plugin
cd CWA-translate-plugin
chmod +x install_unraid.sh
./install_unraid.sh
```

**Post-Install Steps**:
1. Go to your Unraid Docker tab and edit your `calibre-web-automated` container.
2. Add the 3 paths (as instructed by the script) to inject the plugin files.
3. Deploy the newly added `book-translator-api` container.

`deploy_unraid.sh` / `verify_unraid.sh` are personal SSH-based redeploy/verify
helpers for an existing install — read them and adapt the host/paths before use.

> Tip: proxy-injection mode also works on Unraid (run the container with
> `CWA_UPSTREAM` set and browse through its port) and avoids the 3 path
> mappings entirely.

### Advanced: bind-mount install (development / no proxy)

Mount the overlay files directly into the CWA container — useful when hacking
on the overlay itself:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./overlay/read.html:/app/calibre-web-automated/cps/templates/read.html:ro
  - ./static/translator.js:/app/calibre-web-automated/cps/static/js/translator.js:ro
  - ./static/translator.css:/app/calibre-web-automated/cps/static/css/translator.css:ro
```

Caveats: `overlay/read.html` is a full template replacement tracked against
the **pinned CWA version in docker-compose.yml** (`v4.0.6`). A CWA update that
changes `read.html` can drift from this copy — proxy mode does not have this
problem. With bind mounts the API is cross-origin, so set `BT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
(or rely on the private-LAN default) and configure `window.BOOK_TRANSLATOR`
in `overlay/read.html`.

## ⚡ Performance

Throughput and latency depend entirely on your LLM backend (local GPU/model vs. a
cloud API) and on the tunables in [Configuration](#️-configuration) — there is no
single number that applies to every setup, so we don't publish one. Two scripts are
included so you can measure *your* deployment:

- `benchmark.py` — quick concurrent load test against a running API.
- `benchmark_realistic.py` — simulates a realistic reading session (visible-page +
  background prefetch) against a live backend.

Run either with the API up (`python benchmark.py` / `python benchmark_realistic.py`)
and read the printed p50/p95/throughput for your own hardware.

If cold translations feel slow, see `BT_BATCH_SIZE`, `BT_OUTPUT_TOKEN_FACTOR`, and
`BT_MAX_CONCURRENT` below, and `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Environment variables for the `book-translator` container:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CWA_UPSTREAM` | | **Enables proxy-injection mode.** URL of your CWA instance (e.g. `http://calibre-web-automated:8083`). When set, the container also serves CWA with the overlay injected on port `BT_PROXY_PORT`. Unset = API-only (bind-mount installs). |
| `BT_PROXY_PORT` | `8080` | Container port for the injection proxy (proxy mode only). |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `local` | `local`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `groq`, `together`, `minimax`, `deepseek`, `openrouter` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `gemma4-12b` | Model name for the chosen provider |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | | Your API key for the chosen provider (the only supported key mechanism since 2.0.0) |
| `BT_LOCAL_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions` | Only used if `LLM_PROVIDER=local`. OpenAI-compatible endpoint — the **path is always `/v1/chat/completions`** (vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp all speak it); only host:port changes (vLLM `:8000`, LM Studio `:1234`, Ollama `:11434`). **In Docker, `localhost` is the container itself** — use `http://host.docker.internal:<port>/...` or the host IP. |
| `BT_MAX_CONCURRENT` | `2` | Simultaneous translation requests (batches). For a slow single-GPU local model, `1`–`2` is **more** stable than `3` (avoids timeout cascades). |
| `BT_BATCH_SIZE` | `5` | Paragraphs translated per LLM call. `>1` is dramatically faster on slow models (one generation instead of one-per-paragraph); if the model's segmented reply can't be parsed it transparently falls back to per-paragraph. Set `1` for legacy one-call-per-paragraph. |
| `BT_MAX_TOKENS` | `4096` | Hard ceiling on `max_tokens` for a **single**-paragraph request. The actual value sent is the smaller of this and the proportional cap (see `BT_OUTPUT_TOKEN_FACTOR`). |
| `BT_BATCH_MAX_TOKENS` | `8192` | Same ceiling, but for a **batched** (multi-paragraph) request. |
| `BT_OUTPUT_TOKEN_FACTOR` | `2.0` | Caps generated `max_tokens` at `input_tokens × FACTOR + FLOOR`, clamped to the ceiling above. Prevents a rambling/stuck local model from generating thousands of tokens for a short paragraph (the main cause of 8–20s and 120s stalls). `2.0` never truncates real translations; lower it (e.g. `1.6`) for a bit more speed at some risk on very expansive target languages. |
| `BT_OUTPUT_TOKEN_FLOOR` | `256` | Minimum `max_tokens` per request. |
| `BT_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | `0` | Number of surrounding paragraphs included as a do-not-translate `[CONTEXT]` block in batch prompts. Set to `1` or `2` for context-aware translations. Improves literary quality but consumes more tokens per request. |
| `BT_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Seconds before a single translation request is abandoned. Raise it if a slow local model times out on long paragraphs; lower it (with a smaller `BT_BATCH_SIZE`) if you'd rather fail fast under contention. |
| `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER` | | Optional. A secondary provider used automatically when the primary fails (e.g. `minimax` while `local` is slow/down). |
| `LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL` | | Model name for the fallback provider. |
| `LLM_FALLBACK_API_KEY` | | API key for the fallback provider. |
| `BT_API_TOKEN` | | Optional shared secret. When set, translate endpoints require the `X-BT-Token` header — use it if the API is reachable beyond your LAN. In proxy mode set it per-browser via `localStorage.setItem('bt_token', '<token>')`; in bind-mount installs set `apiToken` in `window.BOOK_TRANSLATOR`. |
| `BT_MAX_BATCH_PARAGRAPHS` | `50` | Max paragraphs accepted per `/translate/batch` request (oversized requests get `413`). Protects your GPU/API bill from a single runaway request. |
| `BT_MAX_PARAGRAPH_CHARS` | `8000` | Max characters per paragraph (`413` beyond it). |
| `BT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | `120` | Max requests per client IP per 60s window before the API returns `429`. |
| `BT_RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_AFTER` | `10` | Seconds reported in the `Retry-After` header / response body on a `429`. The frontend reads this and backs off automatically. |
| `BT_TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | When the API sits behind a **trusted** reverse proxy, set `true` to rate-limit by the first `X-Forwarded-For` hop instead of the proxy's own address. |
| `BT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:8083,http://localhost:8383` | Comma-separated exact origins allowed for CORS (bind-mount installs; irrelevant in proxy mode, which is same-origin). Add your public reader URL here, e.g. `https://books.example.com`. |
| `BT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_LAN` | `true` | Additionally allow localhost/RFC1918 origins (`10.*`, `192.168.*`, `172.16-31.*`) on any port — the common self-hosted case. Set `false` to allow only `BT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. |
| `BT_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` | `0` | Optional hard cap on cached translations (`0` = unlimited). When exceeded, the oldest entries are evicted. |
| `DB_PATH` | `translations.db` | Path to the SQLite translation cache. In Docker this should point inside the `/app/data` volume (the provided Dockerfile/compose already set it to `/app/data/translations.db`) so the cache survives container recreation. |
| `PORT` | `8390` | Port the API listens on. If you remap it, also update the `-p`/compose port mapping and any reverse-proxy route — `EXPOSE` in the Dockerfile is documentation only. |

> **Why a single gunicorn worker?** Rate limiting, request metrics, and the health
> cache are kept in process memory for simplicity. Running more than one worker
> would give each its own copy (e.g. the rate limit becoming `N×` the configured
> value). The `--threads 8` setting already gives plenty of request concurrency
> within that one worker — don't raise `--workers` without moving that state to
> something shared (e.g. SQLite, like the translation cache already is).

```

In bind-mount installs nginx never starts; the overlay files are mounted into
CWA and call the API on `:8390` directly (CORS applies — see
`BT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
